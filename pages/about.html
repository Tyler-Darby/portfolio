My name is Tyler Darby and I am a software engineer in the Atlanta area.
<br>
I am currently a senior at the University of Georgia, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
<br><br>
I have been programming for 10 years and my passion for technology has motivated me since I was a child. 
Over the years I've spent learning how to become a proficient engineer and business professional, I have 
become familiar with a wide range of technologies and I have had the opportunity to work with clients and
colleagues across many fields. 
<br><br>
I am also an amateur radio operator with the callsign <a href="https://qrz.com/db/KO4IRP">KO4IRP</a>. I take a particular interest in digital modes
and packet radio, and you may find me working either the DMR network or the 2m and 70cm frequency bands in the metro Atlanta area.
