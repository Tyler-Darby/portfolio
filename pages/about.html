My name is Tyler Darby and I am a software engineer in the Atlanta area.

I am currently a senior at the University of Georgia, pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

I have been programming for 10 years and my passion for technology has motivated me since I was a child. 
Over the years I've spent learning how to become a proficient engineer and business professional, I have 
become familiar with a wide range of technologies and I have had the opportunity to work with clients and
colleagues across many fields.
