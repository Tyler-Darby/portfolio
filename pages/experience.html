<u>Amateur Radio Club at UGA</u><br>
Founding President<br>
2021-Present<br>
As my passion for RF engineering has grown, I have found great fun in the amateur radio community. After recognizing the lack of a community 
of amateur radio operators on campus, I founded the UGARC. In our first semester as a club, we have drawn significant interest and membership, 
formed a relationship with local amateur radio clubs and the Small Satellite Laboratory, and assisted in research for the Department of Defense.

I created 3D Solutions as a firm to represent myself as a freelance developer. During my time doing contract development

of several projects.
