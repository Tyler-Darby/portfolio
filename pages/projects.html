I document most of the personal projects that I create or develop on my blog. I tend to change these from time to time.
You can view my blog by typing the command 'viewblog'. <br>
Below are some of the projects that I have worked on and am proud to showcase. 
<br><br>

<b><u>Barjs</u></b><br> 
Barjs is a service designed to get your things where you need them, with as little hassle as possible. <br>
I was contracted to design the Barjs service as a cross-platform mobile application. This project gave me tremendous 
experience in full-stack development and project management as I was responsible for delivering the entire codebase 
and subcontracting graphic designers and assistant programmers. <br>

<b><u>Orbit</u></b><br>
This project is still in development.<br> 
Orbit is a web-based telecommanding and telemetry monitoring system based on the open-source Yamcs framework. 
Yamcs is a Java-based server at its core, providing functionality for processing and displaying telemetry data and encoding packets for telecommanding. 
The Orbit web interface is a comprehensive dashboard for both monitoring and commanding each of our laboratory's missions in one place.<br>

<b><u>Portfolio</u></b><br>
This portfolio is an ongoing effort and has been a very fun personal project to showcase my work. The site is entirely static
and the blog portions of the site are developed using Jekyll. The site is hosted on Github Pages and the codebase can be found
<a href="">here.</a> I also plan to write a blogpost about the site in the near future and document the creation of the shell interface.
